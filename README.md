### App Description
This app allows you to upload your syllabus from class to the app and the app will be able caputure keywords that user input, such as midterms, finals, office hours, hw, etc and will connect to user's calendar to set up calendar events/reminders, also a to-do lsit for the month

### App Idea Evaluation


- Mobile:
    - The app requires a camera to caputure the syllabus and it can access the calendar on your phone to set up reminders and events on upcoming assignments and tests
    - It is more accessible to a phone than pulling out a laptop 
    - better caemra quaity on phone
    
- Story:
    - normally students will have more than one classes and hence more than one syllabi to handle
    - it is difficult to keep track of all assingments and tests by just having a hard copy syllabus in hand
    - i think most students will respond well with the app since it helps alleviate the burden to keep traack of all their classes at the same time
    
- Market:
    - potential users will be high school and college students
    
- Habit:
    - since the app notify users when the upcoming assignamgs are due and tests, users will be using the app almost to a day to day basis
    - 
- Scope:
    - we believe it will be moderately challenging and the challenge will be on how the camera interacts/detects the syllabus and be able to set up the right calendar events and reminders, but this can be solved by user manully input the info but it will be less convenient
